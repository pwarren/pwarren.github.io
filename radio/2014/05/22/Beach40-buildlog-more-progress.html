<p>Stuffed a few more bits on the beach40. Got the ring mixer in, and the first transformer. Also managed to solder a SOIC-8 chip to a MePad :)</p>

<p>Slowly slowly! But it shouldnâ€™t be too long before I have at least a reciever!</p>

<p>Yes my copper is getting a bit dirty, will give it a good clean before soldering much more on!</p>

<p>I think the weekend will be spent building up a digital interface with VOX circuit for my MST2, and will be able to be used on the Beach40 when it gets there!</p>
