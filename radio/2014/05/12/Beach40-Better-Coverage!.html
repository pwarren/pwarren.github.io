<p>Well, after some help from the <a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Minimalist_QRP_Transceivers/info">Minimalist-QRP</a> yahoo group and members of the #nest freenode irc channel, I’ve got my oscillator going a bit better!</p>

<p>It now covers from 7.0041 MHz to 7.2405 MHz, a much more useful range of the 40m band!</p>

<p>In the end I used two 7.2 MHz ceramic resonators in parallel, with the O leg of a jaycar varicap and a 1 µH inductor in series with that.<br /><!--more--></p>

<p>The wave form does look a bit wonky down the low end, but is a lovely sinusoid at about 1vp-p from about 7.08 up.</p>

<p>Will have to wait until payday to get the next lot of bits from Jaycar to continue building, but it’s been fun so far :)</p>
