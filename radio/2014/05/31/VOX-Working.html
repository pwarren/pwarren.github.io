<p>Well, after a week or so of experimentation, I’ve got a VOX circuit that works with my <a href="http://ozqrp.com">OzQRP MST2</a>! In addition to the below VOX circuit, I put in isolation transformers and 40dB attenuators for the MST2’s speaker out to my sound card’s microphone input, and similarly for the revrse: sound card speaker out to MST2 microphone in.</p>

<p>I had to adapt various circuits I found on the web, as they didn’t exactly suit what I needed to do, But I’ve finally got there! Now I just need to make a contact with it! I’ll try for some PSK contacts over the weekend, and finally attempt some <a href="http:/freedv.org">FreeDV</a> contacts too.</p>

<p>Here’s what it looks like hooked up to the MST2 (but not to USB as I was packing up and thought I better take a snap or two!)</p>

<p>I’m using a 4 pin microphone socket on the soundcard end, with PTT and microphone level audio going to the MST2 via shielded 4 core audio cable and some 4 pin mic plugs. Next time I’ll do that a bit differently, maybe soldering the sound card end directly in, instead of another plug and socket.</p>

<p>Here’s a bit of a closer look at the electrically finished circuit.</p>

<p>Next step, after getting some contacts will be to find a suitable box for it!</p>
