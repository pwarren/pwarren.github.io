Title: SOTA Activation!
tags: amateur radio MST2 SOTA
---
Today was the VK1 (And most of the rest of VK!) [SOTA](http://sota.org.uk) party, and I did my first ever activation on Mt Ainslie, VK1/AC-040, and had a bit of fun!  I learnt just how far down the hill the activation zone starts, 25m altitude is a bit further than I thought!

Here's my chair at the summit pole, the end fed antenna is strung up in the trees to the left.

I didn't get my Beach40 working in time, so I was on 20m, 2m and 70cm. Managed 9 contacts, 7 of which were Summit 2 Summit:

40m was where it was at, with some of the other guys getting over 60 contacts! So, for next time, I'd better get the beach40 fixed, or figure out a different way to get the band up!
