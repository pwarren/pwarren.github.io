In preperation for the next VHF/UHF field day, and for the 2015 SOTA challenge, I thought I'd build a proper antenna for 6m.

After some googling, a delta loop looked easy enough to build, so according to the instructions from [GW7AAV](http://www.gw7aav.com/main-index/antenna-index/antenna-design/6m-delta), I built myself one with bits I had lying around, and managed to fit it to the squidpole for SOTA ops.

So for the new year UTC rollover, I was up at Booroomba Rocks, VK1/AC-026, and had a few contacts on 6m, furthest I think was to Longbeach NSW, about 113km. Not to bad for a first effort I reckon!
