				<title>Dipole Up!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My legs are now a bit stiff and sore from going up and down a ladder for a few hours yesterday afternoon. Made a homebrew dipole with some cut and drilled $2 shop polyethylene chopping board and some cheap coax and wire from Jaycar. I used coax wound around a little toroid as a common mode choke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/dipole_centre.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/dipole_centre.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to get it up about 10m above ground, and only smashed one tile in the process! Have some plastic over the hole, and will be back up to fix that next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to go up a few times as I was tuning it, too long to start with, then not quite short enough, then too short, finally got it! It has a 1.2SWR between 14.000 and 14.75MHz, which I think is good enough for now. I ended up with close to 9.52m of wire, as recommended by various hams, I’ve reduced the length by folding back about 70cm on each end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get the S-Meter pegging that I see with the end fed antenna. Which I think may be to RF energy getting in to the Mic leads. Will investigate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to work well, have received WSPR from Europe and NZ with it, with audio going to my PC via an isolated attunuator, more on this in a future post! Hopefully I’ll be able to get a few contacts on it this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beach40 Buildlog More Progress</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Stuffed a few more bits on the beach40. Got the ring mixer in, and the first transformer. Also managed to solder a SOIC-8 chip to a MePad :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40_2014-05-22.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40_2014-05-22.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly slowly! But it shouldn’t be too long before I have at least a reciever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes my copper is getting a bit dirty, will give it a good clean before soldering much more on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the weekend will be spent building up a digital interface with VOX circuit for my MST2, and will be able to be used on the Beach40 when it gets there!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>First Proper Hf Contact</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m at home watching the kids, and I decided to try some 20m contacts. After mucking about a bit with end fed half wave antennas, and not being happy with it, I decided to make the wire as per the instructions for the L-Match tuner I built (based on Peter, VK3YE’s HF Portable youtube series), and 22m of wire appears to work much better than the 12m I did have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a contact with Ron, VK3AFW portable 4, as he was doing a SOTA activation on VK4/SE105, which is a distance of 1249.8 km from home and I got a report of 5 and 7, which I hope isn’t too bad with my 5 watts output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strung the 22m wire up as an inverted V with the peak about 9m up the Chinese Elm in the back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The max RF field strength is no longer on the far edge of the varicap’s range and signals are a little easier to detect. The only issue I’m having is that the power meter in the radio gets pegged at maximum even with no voice being transmitted, just a carrier. This didn’t happen with VK1GH’s tuned dipole, on that I got peaks in cadence with my voice. I got a contact, so it mustn’t be too much of an issue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next weekend I’ll turn the 12m of wire into a 20m dipole I’ll string up at home in a more permanent fashion. I’m borrowing the clubs antenna tuner so I should be able to trim that nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Beach40 Better Coverage!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, after some help from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Minimalist_QRP_Transceivers/info&quot;&gt;Minimalist-QRP&lt;/a&gt; yahoo group and members of the #technest freenode irc channel, I’ve got my oscillator going a bit better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now covers from 7.0041 MHz to 7.2405 MHz, a much more useful range of the 40m band!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I used two 7.2 MHz ceramic resonators in parallel, with the O leg of a jaycar varicap and a 1 µH inductor in series with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wave form does look a bit wonky down the low end, but is a lovely sinusoid at about 1vp-p from about 7.08 up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will have to wait until payday to get the next lot of bits from Jaycar to continue building, but it’s been fun so far :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Beach40 Start</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve started building Peter Parker &lt;a href=&quot;http://vk3ye.com&quot;&gt;VK3YE&lt;/a&gt;’s 40m Dual Side Band transciever, completing the oscillator Manhattan Style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40_circuit1.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40_circuit1.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve built it with some 7.2MHz resonators from &lt;a href=&quot;http://minikits.com.au&quot;&gt;MiniKits&lt;/a&gt;, and with the 60-160 pF variable cap I have, it gets me from 6.938MHz to 7.049MHz. Which is not terribly useful for the 20m band (7.0 -&amp;gt; 7.3 MHz). So I’ll have to tweak things and work out how to get more swing from the oscillator. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40_testing_oscillator.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40_testing_oscillator.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

				<title>Mst2 20m Buildlog Day Something</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, after getting my MST2 in an enclosure and looking Ok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_box.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_box.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a friendly ham’s workshop and started aligning it. The receive slug tuning and mixer balancing went perfectly well. When we got to doing the transmit tuning, things started to go a bit skee-whiff! The MST2 turned off. So we replaced the fuse, which promptly blew, and another!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After turning the PA bias and mic gain down, and unshorting the PTT line and trying another fuse the magic smoke came out of the MOSFET!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then tested the audio generator, and it was putting out 1v peak to peak, instaed of the 50mV we’d set it to, so we figure the MOSFET was being overdriven for a significant period of time (10 minutes or so!), and decided it had had enough of that, and gave up the ghost :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_blown_final.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_blown_final.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now to find a source of IRF510 MOSFETs!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Mst2 20m Buildlog Day 2 And 3</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday we continued the odyssey, and got all the capacitors and transistors in, finishing off today with the transformers and chokes, pin headers and crystals, so we’re all done for the easy bits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_finished.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/MST2_20m_finished.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few oddities, the instructions specified 1.8pF NPO caps, but the kit came with 2pF caps in place. I have a left over 2 pin header (which I just realised should go on the VFO input!), and no 3 pin header for the DDS-VFO power, a bit odd, but easily worked around :) &lt;!--more--&gt; Winding the transformers and chokes was easier than I thought, but they don’t look terribly even and neat, hope that doesn’t have too much of an effect on the output!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My soldering has definitely improved a little over the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It powers on and draws the right amount of current, and the oscillator puts out a good sine wave, which is all I had the energy for today, before coming down with a bit of a cold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit will have to wait until the pots, connectors and case arrive! Hopefully I’m all better when they arrive :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Mst2 20m Buildlog Day1</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In continuation of my radio building, I have started on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ozqrp.com&quot;&gt;OzQRP&lt;/a&gt; MST2, 20m band SSB radio kit. Ordered on Wednesday, it arrived Thursday afternoon! It helps that I live quite close to where they’re sent from!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve put together the DDS VFO and the LED S-Meter, my soldering was a bit rusty, but I’ve definitely improved over the two pieces, and the borrowing of a Hakko 936 from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makehackvoid.com&quot;&gt;MakeHackVoid&lt;/a&gt;, the local hackerspace, certainly assisted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/DDS_VFO_working.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/DDS_VFO_working.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only put 3 components in the wrong spot, but it wasn’t too hard to pull them out and put in the right ones, a bit tedious though! Here’s some detail of the bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/SMeter_detail.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/SMeter_detail.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/SMeter_reverse_detail.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/SMeter_reverse_detail.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/DDS_VFO_detail.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/DDS_VFO_detail.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the slightly harder bit, building the radio board! Have to hand wind some RF transformers, at least there’s no SMT soldering! Then the really hard bit, drilling and cutting the enclosure faces and mounting the hardware. Will post as I complete bits!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I tried doing a callback after the WIA broadcast, but wasn’t heard from my in-laws at griffith. I think Red Hill was in the way! but I could hear the broadcast Ok from outside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
