				<title>Beach40 Finished</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the soldering is finished anyway! Still have to find a box, get all the connecting hardware, shield the oscillator, and build the L-Match circuit (and maybe the fine tuning circuit, and RF pre-amp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-07-09.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-07-09.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TX was working fine as I put the driver circuit in, will test the RF AMP after I build a dummy load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RX on the other hand, does not appear to be going so well! There is a large difference on the scope at various points along the RX chain between when my 20m 1/2 wave dipole antenna is connected vs without, but there appears to be no change in the audio output at the headphones. I’ve tried having the phones in series and parallel, little difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the circuit, tho it’s hard to see all the details. I’ll have to check the schematic and make sure I’ve got it all together properly!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beach40 Transmitting!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Have got my Beach40’s mic amplifier in, and tweaked the carrier suppression via the balance pot and cap. I’m managing a carrier suppression of 24 dB, which i don’t think is too bad for a first time homebrew build, but I do need to get some non-capacitative flathead drivers, would make these things a bit easier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-07-02-1.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-07-02-1.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also added a banana plug output to the Kenwood’s power supply to allow power to get to the Beach40 and my MST2. It taks up a significantly smaller amount of desk real-estate than the old HP PSU. It does have a bit less power output, the Kenwood is 10A continuous, and the HP is about double that. But they’re both a bit more than is needed for the 100W rig, let alone the homebrew bits!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40-and-PSU.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40-and-PSU.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, next I need to get to Jaycar to pick up some more resistors, as I’ve run of the needed values! Then getting on to building the RF amplifier stages, and debugging the receiver side.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Audio Amp Done</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Got the audio amp done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-06-25.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-06-25.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even manages to amplify a 50Hz hum to audible levels when I accidentally touched the diode ring with my finger :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Lesson Learnt 001</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally collected all the extra bits I needed, and had an hour or two to proceed further with my Beach40 build, and got my recieve audio amplifier circuit built:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-06-24.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40-2014-06-24.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more experienced of you can probably see exactly what I’ve done wrong there. That photo is from after I’d removed the broken bits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lesson I learnt was, always double check the pinout of your chip :) I had thought the pins were numbered down each side, but they are in fact numbered in a circular fasion. So I had +12V going in to the audio out pin of the lm386.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this didn’t end well! The input voltage resistor went pop, started glowing white, and let out the magic smoke, there’s also some damage to the packaging of the lm386 chip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I have a spare lm386 in my junque box, so I’ll stick that in tomorrow, and see how I go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Vox Working</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, after a week or so of experimentation, I’ve got a VOX circuit that works with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://ozqrp.com&quot;&gt;OzQRP MST2&lt;/a&gt;! In addition to the below VOX circuit, I put in isolation transformers and 40dB attenuators for the MST2’s speaker out to my sound card’s microphone input, and similarly for the revrse: sound card speaker out to MST2 microphone in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/vox_cct.png&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/vox_cct.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to adapt various circuits I found on the web, as they didn’t exactly suit what I needed to do, But I’ve finally got there! Now I just need to make a contact with it! I’ll try for some PSK contacts over the weekend, and finally attempt some &lt;a href=&quot;http:/freedv.org&quot;&gt;FreeDV&lt;/a&gt; contacts too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it looks like hooked up to the MST2 (but not to USB as I was packing up and thought I better take a snap or two!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/vox_built.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/vox_built.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using a 4 pin microphone socket on the soundcard end, with PTT and microphone level audio going to the MST2 via shielded 4 core audio cable and some 4 pin mic plugs. Next time I’ll do that a bit differently, maybe soldering the sound card end directly in, instead of another plug and socket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bit of a closer look at the electrically finished circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/vox_built2.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/vox_built2.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step, after getting some contacts will be to find a suitable box for it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Dipole Up!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;My legs are now a bit stiff and sore from going up and down a ladder for a few hours yesterday afternoon. Made a homebrew dipole with some cut and drilled $2 shop polyethylene chopping board and some cheap coax and wire from Jaycar. I used coax wound around a little toroid as a common mode choke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/dipole_centre.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/dipole_centre.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to get it up about 10m above ground, and only smashed one tile in the process! Have some plastic over the hole, and will be back up to fix that next weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to go up a few times as I was tuning it, too long to start with, then not quite short enough, then too short, finally got it! It has a 1.2SWR between 14.000 and 14.75MHz, which I think is good enough for now. I ended up with close to 9.52m of wire, as recommended by various hams, I’ve reduced the length by folding back about 70cm on each end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get the S-Meter pegging that I see with the end fed antenna. Which I think may be to RF energy getting in to the Mic leads. Will investigate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to work well, have received WSPR from Europe and NZ with it, with audio going to my PC via an isolated attunuator, more on this in a future post! Hopefully I’ll be able to get a few contacts on it this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beach40 Buildlog More Progress</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Stuffed a few more bits on the beach40. Got the ring mixer in, and the first transformer. Also managed to solder a SOIC-8 chip to a MePad :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#39;fancybox&#39; href=&#39;/images/beach40_2014-05-22.jpg&#39; rel=&#39;group&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;/images/beach40_2014-05-22.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly slowly! But it shouldn’t be too long before I have at least a reciever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes my copper is getting a bit dirty, will give it a good clean before soldering much more on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the weekend will be spent building up a digital interface with VOX circuit for my MST2, and will be able to be used on the Beach40 when it gets there!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>First Proper Hf Contact</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m at home watching the kids, and I decided to try some 20m contacts. After mucking about a bit with end fed half wave antennas, and not being happy with it, I decided to make the wire as per the instructions for the L-Match tuner I built (based on Peter, VK3YE’s HF Portable youtube series), and 22m of wire appears to work much better than the 12m I did have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a contact with Ron, VK3AFW portable 4, as he was doing a SOTA activation on VK4/SE105, which is a distance of 1249.8 km from home and I got a report of 5 and 7, which I hope isn’t too bad with my 5 watts output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strung the 22m wire up as an inverted V with the peak about 9m up the Chinese Elm in the back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The max RF field strength is no longer on the far edge of the varicap’s range and signals are a little easier to detect. The only issue I’m having is that the power meter in the radio gets pegged at maximum even with no voice being transmitted, just a carrier. This didn’t happen with VK1GH’s tuned dipole, on that I got peaks in cadence with my voice. I got a contact, so it mustn’t be too much of an issue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next weekend I’ll turn the 12m of wire into a 20m dipole I’ll string up at home in a more permanent fashion. I’m borrowing the clubs antenna tuner so I should be able to trim that nicely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

				<title>Beach40 Better Coverage!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, after some help from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Minimalist_QRP_Transceivers/info&quot;&gt;Minimalist-QRP&lt;/a&gt; yahoo group and members of the #technest freenode irc channel, I’ve got my oscillator going a bit better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now covers from 7.0041 MHz to 7.2405 MHz, a much more useful range of the 40m band!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I used two 7.2 MHz ceramic resonators in parallel, with the O leg of a jaycar varicap and a 1 µH inductor in series with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wave form does look a bit wonky down the low end, but is a lovely sinusoid at about 1vp-p from about 7.08 up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will have to wait until payday to get the next lot of bits from Jaycar to continue building, but it’s been fun so far :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
