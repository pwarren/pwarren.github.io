				<title>ARPS working and update!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally figured out all the bits for running APRS for tracking to and from my activations, worked well for my last activation of Webb’s Ridge. That’s a bit of a slower drive up via Blue Range Rd out in the brindies, good fun if a bit chilly towards the end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2016-06-18-APRS.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-06-18-APRS.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;APRS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased an FT-897, mostly so that the car has a reasonable HF capable radio for bigger trips, and so I have a bit more power on the 2m and 70cm bands.  Works well from that perspective! It’s also useful to have a bit more grunt for APRS tracking too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the rest of the setup is a BeagleBone Black which has a built in sound card, running Cubian, with Direwolf doing all the heavy lifting for the Smart Beacon.  I have an Arduino thing that has a GPS chip built in that connects as an NMEA compatible device over the USB port. And finally a cheap chinese imported interface cable that does PTT over the DTR line of a USB Serial thingo, and audio in and out from the Data port on the 897.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antenna is an Andrews Communications copy of a diamond apparently. It mostly works, but isn’t that much better than the 1/4 wave on 2m wobbly antenna that replaced the rubber ducky for my handheld, but it works :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image, it works reasonably well, there are some obvious outliers of locations I was never at, not entirely sure what’s going on there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently sitting listening on 144.2MHz for the VHF/UHF field day, nothing heard so far :( The weather is pretty horrible, maybe some more overnight or in the morning. I’m hoping to get up to Ginini for at least 8 hours for the November field day, on the 6,2,70,23 and 9cm bands! I have all the necessary bits for 6 2 and 70.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 23cm, I have two upconverters, which were for ancient satellites that had 23cm uplink and 2m downlink, there should be enough to get a transverter going there.  For 9cm I have two of the Geelong panels, and hopefully I know have enough components to get them going!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mt Pinnibar SOTA activation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d decided to try and drive the triton up Mt Pinnibar while camping with the family at Geehi, 33km past Thredbo on the Apline Way. Geehi’s a lovely spot, and I recommend it for camping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left medium&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2016-04-26-Geehi.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-04-26-Geehi.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Campsite setup at Geehi&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was going to attempt FreeDV on 40 and 20 before moving to SSB, but had neglected to factor in the limitations of having the family along for the ride! The kids did have a wonderful time, but by the time I’d done a 70cm S2S to Andrew VK1AD they were already starting to get restless! So a quick go on 40m and we had to corall the kids a little, and head back down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2016-04-26-Pinnibar.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2016-04-26-Pinnibar.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Me activating Mt Pinnibar with kids having lunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive up from the north side was quite easy, a stock 4x4 vehicle should have no difficulty in dry conditions, low range in my opinion is required for safety! In the wet, I think it would be a completely different story, there are long sections of quite steep clay base track, which would be super slippery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove out via Mt Anderson and the Tom Groggin track, again quite easy.  All in all a lovely day out!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Back Again</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;So, I haven’t looked at this site for a while, and discovered that it had completely b0rkened!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github pages decided to do SSL by default, with strict transport security on all github.io domains.  This is great! An awesome idea, but, it doesn’t work if you have a custom domain, such as mine :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve fixed it all up by going the easy way out and hosting the blog on my home server again. I may end up moving it to a VPS or similar one day, but it’s good for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of radio and SOTA activities, I’ve not had a lot of outings over Christmas and in the new year. Some illness and busyness with looking after kids has prevented me from doing much more than quick drive-ups. Hopefully that’ll change over the year, but we’ll see how we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve bought a Mitsubishi Triton, which should help me get up the harder peaks not too far away, and get the family out camping. Geehi in the April school holidays is our next one, hope to activate Mt Pinnibar on the Saturday, further details on SOTAWatch as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Yellow Rabbit Hill SOTA activation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Well, time to get out of the shack again!  Decided on Yellow Rabbit hill, a nice drive up summit with a short walk to the top!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite rumours, once you’re on the right roads, this isn’t too hard to find, especially when you follow Andrew VK1NAM’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vk1nam.wordpress.com/tag/yellow-rabbit-hill/&quot;&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; correctly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-cairn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-cairn.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Summit Cairn, with rocks added!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn’t, and got a bit lost. On the upside, I had a lovely time driving about in the forests of Namadgi National Park!  Looking at Andrew’s Google Earth maps, I’d thought that we needed the end of Warks road that comes of the dirt section of Brindabella Rd, this is not the case! Take the Warks road that’s at the bottom of a dip, while still on the tarmac, and you’ll get there much more easily!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-shack.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-shack.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SOTA shack from the cairn&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the right roads, it’s a good fun drive to near the car park near the top. Slow and steady and you’ll be fine, even in a 2wd with normal clearance. My stock Subaru Impreza 2.0i had no trouble at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the top, started out with a few quickfire 10m contacts before heading down to 40m to get SE VK locals. I then tried 20m with no results this time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-mist.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-07-05-mist.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mist through the trees&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

				<title>Tyrell&#39;s Ridge VK2/SM-096 SOTA Activation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’d planned a camping trip a few months ago with some friends at Geehi in the snowy mountains, a 45 minute drive, about 35kms past Thredbo on the Apline Way. So, thinking about it a bit more, I decided to see if there are any close by SOTA peaks, lo and behold, there are two, Mt Youngall a 10 pointer, and Tyrell’s Ridge, 4 points and not previously activated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to Tyrell’s Ridge, VK2/SM-096 is not too bad, turn off Alpine Way at the Geehi Horse Trailer carpark and follow the track into the bush, it says ‘4wd only in dry weather’ but the track would be navigable by 2wd in dry, no clearance issues, but there are steep sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a nice spot to park near a ridge that runs up to the top and walked up to the summit, it took me a bit less than an hour, and was a bit of a slog through some wet, thick regrowth from fires in the area some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-parking.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-parking.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Parked on the trail, looking east&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got there it started a very light rain, so I set myself with my japara protecting the radio and logbook, made me a bit wet, but the radio kept working! After starting out with AM on 7.140MHz for 15 minutes or so with no takers, I found a clear frequency and started the CQ calls, and after 5 minutes or so I had a taker who spotted me and then I was away! I managed 20 contacts over the next little while.  I did try 14.310 and 21.250 MHz, but no takers on there either. Not being able to spot from the summit made it a bit more difficult! There might be mobile phone reception for the various phone apps on Mt Youngall, the next nearest summit, but driving along the road, the closest is probably Khancoban, or back to Thredbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-bush.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-bush.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Thick bush to traipse through&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, the rain started to get a bit heavier, and towards the end of an hour or so, I was very cold and had most definitely had enough of this! I again omitted to take photos of the SOTA station, one day I’ll remember it in time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A careful slog back to the car to a change of clothes and some food! Had to Sit in the car for a bit to warm up, then drove in to Khancoban, stopping at Scammell’s ridge lookout and spotted some snow on the hills! Alpine way’s a hard drive, and should be taken with care, especially in the wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-snow.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-04-25-snow.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Snow from Scammell&#39;s lookout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather difficult activation for me, and I think next time, I’ll not try activating a summit in the wet. It’s not much fun at all! Alternatively, I should get myself a bothy bag I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Beach 40 Contact and general radio update!</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few weeks I’ve debugged my Beach40 a bit! I found that I’d stuck in the wrong size resistor on the lm386 feedback circuit, 2.2 Ohms, vs the needed 2.2 kilo-Ohms! So, with that fixed, it worked a bit better!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right large&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-03-22-Beach40-Setup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-03-22-Beach40-Setup.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Beach40 as set for a QSO, and a messy desk! http://openradio.net.au board in the background&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio was still rather low, so I added in the BC548 RF pre-amp, which boosted the signal up very well, can get too loud now with the headphones on! Unfortunately, it had the side effect of increasing the AM broadcast break-in, meaning I could hear Radio National across the dial!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I built a high pass filter, and stick that inline to the Beach40.  I had put one internally to start with, but it functioned more as an attenuator, than a filter!  Now that I’ve built one that works, I might try to integrate it into the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, now I’ve finally had a contact with it!  VK1DA was activating the local repeater site for SOTA, and I managed to get a 3x2 report from him with the radio, which was a bit lower than I thought I should get. Putting it on the dummy load, the scope is seeing ~5V peak to peak, which may be a bit lower than expected, might check the resistors in the RF amplification stage, see if I got any of those wrong!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yay, my first home brew radio success, very pleased with myself :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a learning experience, I’ve been putting my Beach40 circuit into &lt;a href=&quot;http://kicad.org&quot;&gt;KiCAD&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find all the work I’ve done, at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pwarren/electronics/&quot;&gt;Git Hub&lt;/a&gt;. I did have plans of doing an all SMT layout for the board, but I think I’ll save that for my next challenge, an SSB home-brew rig!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be looking at the “Let’s Build Something” series from Pete, N6QW, details on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jessystems.com/LBS_Detail.htm&quot;&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;. I already had a few of the bits, and have since bought a bunch more! Hope to have the Part 1 bits done this week, to get me a direct conversion receiver done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pwarren/Si5351Sketches&quot;&gt;hacking&lt;/a&gt; away at the arduino code for the Si5351 clock chip that the design uses for a VFO and BFO, I have it mostly working with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://freetronics.com.au&quot;&gt;Freetronics&lt;/a&gt; LCD board and their ‘eleven’ and arduino uno clone.  I have some rotary encoders, now, so that should progress eventually!  Lots to do!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mt Ginini</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A public holiday Monday with lovely weather, and some restless kids, so I took them up the hills to let Mum have a bit of a rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy drive up to the summit, taking a bit over one and a half hours. Up the top there are a large number of antennas for various radio services, including the local repeater, VK1RGI. They do interfere a bit, my cheapo chinese HT didn’t cope too well, and got some interference from what sounded like some sort of aircraft service, so I missed a few calls on 2m!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right larger&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-03-09-sota-shack.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-03-09-sota-shack.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;SOTA Shack on Mt Ginini looking south&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kids had a pretty good time, and after munching on some sandwidches, settled down with their toys, and I settled down to radios!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On HF, the noises aren’t too bad, and had a successful activation, grabbing 31 QSOs in total, getting VK4,5 and 6 on 20m, and 1,2 and 3 on 40, and got a second Summit to Summit to VK7, qualifying me for a mountain hunter for the region, yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather up on the summit was lovely, nice and warm, with enough wind that it wasn’t too hot when moving about, and enough to fly my box kite for a while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-03-09-kite.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-03-09-kite.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;4yo daughter flying the kite&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside was being distracted by the kids when packing, and leaving my squidpole leaning against the tree I’d tied it to :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah well, Andrew, VK1DA will be up there shortly, hopefully it survives the intervening time and he’s able to bring it back safely!

				<title>Mt Stromlo and 1000 QSOs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Another SOTA activation for me, having come out of a flu and some other health issues, thought I’d try for an easy one! Mt Stromlo is an easy walk from the carpark up to the summit, then on to the northern hump, so I took a chair this time too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I noticed the QSO count was at 999, so I asked on the VK1 SOTA list to see if anyone else wanted to grab it, Matt, VK1MA said that he didn’t mind, as long as he was the 1000th QSO, and as he’s the first activator of Mt Stromle, I thought I’d head out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2015-02-15-Stromlo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2015-02-15-Stromlo.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Me activating Mt Stromlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d organised with Matt to call him first on 2m FM, so I did that, and had a good chat to get the 1000th QSO! also got Andrew VK1NAM on 2m, and had a bit of trouble with Al, VK1RX, Which I think might have been my HT’s battery deciding it wasn’t going to give enough voltage on TX, tho I did switch to my 817 on 2m FM, and still no luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to 40m, signals were a bit down until about 0500 UTC, and I only managed 11 QSOs for the summit, 1 on 20m, and none on 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard some voices come up on 20m, but I got no intelligence, and then they started some CW, I have a feeling it may have been VK3MCD/7 activating in Tasmania. Unfortunately I don’t yet follow CW at all :( so some more incentive to learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another activation point, and a pleasant afternoon out of the house!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Booroomba Rocks SOTA activation</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I had some time to get out and do some SOTA for the new year rollover and decided to do a bit more of a tricky one Booroomba Rocks, VK1/AC-026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a lovely drive out to the trail head, winding through the Namadgi National Park, and some interesting driving on 3kms of steep winding dirt road. Then the walk up is pretty steep to start off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get to the cliffs without too much difficulty, but then finding my way up to the summit was a bit trickier!  I did, after some scrabbling through the bush, and getting disoriented, and slightly lost, find my way to the cairn marked trail. When I could see the summit, I decided I’d had enough of this rubbish, and since I was in the activation zone decided to set up and get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to remember the sunscreen this time, and Applied liberally to my face and arms, forgetting my legs :(  The soaked myself with some Bushman’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got set for some 6m stuff, managed a QSO 113km away with VK2DO, and a s2s with Vk1NAM and VK1DA on the not too far away Mt Tumanang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then settled in for 40m, which was going off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 9 QSOs before the rollover, one of which was not a S2S. After the rollover 28, with 5 non-s2s contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, I was time constrained, and had to go before getting the epic amount of contacts some people managed, but I did manage to chase a VK7 summit finally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to make sure I have more time up on the summit, so I don’t feel rushed and start making mistakes
I need to get some maps, and a compass, and practice navigation.
I should take some food, and make sure to eat it on the summit. Especially when it’s getting close to lunch time.
I need to put sunscreen on more regularly, and put it on everywhere that’s bare!
I need to scout the route more thoroughly before setting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water was about right this time. Took 2.5L up the hill and drank 2L while out, and another 600 mL or so on the drive home.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>6m Delta loop</title>

&lt;figure class=&quot;right smaller&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;fancybox&quot; rel=&quot;group&quot; href=&quot;/images/2014-12-30-6m-delta-loop-rolled.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2014-12-30-6m-delta-loop-rolled.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;6m Delta loop rolled up for travel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preperation for the next VHF/UHF field day, and for the 2015 SOTA challenge, I thought I’d build a proper antenna for 6m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some googling, a delta loop looked easy enough to build, so according to the instructions from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gw7aav.com/main-index/antenna-index/antenna-design/6m-delta&quot;&gt;GW7AAV&lt;/a&gt;, I built myself one with bits I had lying around, and managed to fit it to the squidpole for SOTA ops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the new year UTC rollover, I was up at Booroomba Rocks, VK1/AC-026, and had a few contacts on 6m, furthest I think was to Longbeach NSW, about 113km. Not to bad for a first effort I reckon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the support, I have 2 bits of PVC pipe about 1m long, joined with a T-joint which has a ~15mm hole drilled in the centre so it sits down the squidpole a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support the wire, I drilled a 3mm hole about 3mm in from the end of both pipes, then pulled the bit to the edge to create a bit of a notch for the wire to lay in.&lt;/p&gt;
