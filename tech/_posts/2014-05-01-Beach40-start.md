I've started building Peter Parker [VK3YE](http://vk3ye.com)'s 40m Dual Side Band transciever, completing the oscillator Manhattan Style:

I've built it with some 7.2MHz resonators from [MiniKits](http://minikits.com.au), and with the 60-160 pF variable cap I have, it gets me from 6.938MHz to 7.049MHz. Which is not terribly useful for the 20m band (7.0 -> 7.3 MHz). So I'll have to tweak things and work out how to get more swing from the oscillator.
