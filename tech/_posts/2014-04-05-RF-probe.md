Title: RF Probe - Manhattan Style!
tags: tech electronics

Well, I started my radio building journey today, by building an RF probe:

It was quite tedious to cut the little squares, so I think I'll get some of the QRPMe [MeSquares](http://qrpme.com/?p=product&id=MES)

or maybe a hole punch from Bunnings :)

Anyway, it works well, produces about 2v on my multimeter when keying my Baofeng 2m/70cm radio right next to the little antenna. Very pleased :)
