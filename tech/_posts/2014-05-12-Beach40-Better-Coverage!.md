Title: Beach40 Better Coverage!

Well, after some help from the [Minimalist-QRP](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Minimalist_QRP_Transceivers/info) yahoo group and members of the #technest freenode irc channel, I've got my oscillator going a bit better!  

It now covers from 7.0041 MHz to 7.2405 MHz, a much more useful range of the 40m band!

In the end I used two 7.2 MHz ceramic resonators in parallel, with the O leg of a jaycar varicap and a 1 &micro;H inductor in series with that.  

The wave form does look a bit wonky down the low end, but is a lovely sinusoid at about 1vp-p from about 7.08 up.

Will have to wait until payday to get the next lot of bits from Jaycar to continue building, but it's been fun so far :)
