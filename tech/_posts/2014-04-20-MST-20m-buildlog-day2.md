Well, yesterday we continued the oddysey, and got all the capacitors and transistor's in, finishing off today with the transformers and chokes, pin headers and crystals, so we're all done!

I had a few oddities, the instructions specified 1.8pF NPO caps, but the kit came with 2pF caps in place. I have a left over 2 pin header, and no 3 pin header for the DDS-VFO power, which appears to only take 2 pins for power anyway., not sure about that as yet.

My soldering has definitely improved a little over the weekend!

It even powers on and draws the right amount of current, and the oscillator puts out a good sine wave, which is all I had the energy for today, before coming down with a bit of a cold!

The next bit will have to wait until the pots, connectors and case arrive!
