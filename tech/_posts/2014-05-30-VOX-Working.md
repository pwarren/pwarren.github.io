Title: VOX Working!

Well, after a week or so of experimentation, I've got a VOX circuit that works with my [OzQRP MST2](http://ozqrp.com)!  In addition to the below VOX circuit, I put in isolation transformers and 40dB attenuators for the MST2's speaker out to my sound card's microphone input, and similarly for the revrse: sound card speaker out to MST2 microphone in.

I had to adapt various circuits I found on the web, as they didn't exactly suit what I needed to do, But I've finally got there!  Now I just need to make a contact with it! I'll try for some PSK contacts over the weekend, and finally attempt some [FreeDV](http:/freedv.org) contacts too.

Here's what it looks like hooked up to the MST2 (but not to USB as I was packing up and thought I better take a snap or two!)

I'm using a 4 pin microphone socket on the soundcard end, with PTT and microphone level audio going to the MST2 via shielded 4 core audio cable and some 4 pin mic plugs. Next time I'll do that a bit differently, maybe soldering the sound card end directly in, instead of another plug and socket.

Here's a bit of a closer look at the electrically finished circuit.

Next step, after getting some contacts will be to find a suitable box for it!
