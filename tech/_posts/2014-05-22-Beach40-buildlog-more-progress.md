Stuffed a few more bits on the beach40. Got the ring mixer in, and the first transformer.  Also managed to solder a SOIC-8 chip to a MePad :)

Slowly slowly! But it shouldn't be too long before I have at least a reciever!

Yes my copper is getting a bit dirty, will give it a good clean before soldering much more on!	

I think the weekend will be spent building up a digital interface with VOX circuit for my MST2, and will be able to be used on the Beach40 when it gets there!
